## April 2024 - RTL support, new member

### RTL support

One of the most missing features is the RTL support for the components, so we provided the fix for that, so now every component in the registry gonna make the write adjusments for the ui and functionality based on the dir property.

#### Example

This example showcases the carousel component

<ComponentPreview name="carousel-rtl-support"  />

<Alert className="mt-4" variant="info">
  <MdxIcons.AlertTriangle className="size-4" />
  <AlertTitle>Good to know</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    The carousel component has 2 ways for the direction one is using the `dir` prop , and the other one is to use `carouselOptions` as the embla carousel provides a <Link target="_blank"  href="https://www.embla-carousel.com/api/options/#direction" className="font-semibold" >
    Direction prop</Link> that suport both
