# Shadcn-Extension

A CLI (inspired by and meant to work with shadcn-ui) for adding components to your project, making it easier to integrate and manage UI components within your codebase.

## Usage

### Initializing a New Project

Use the `init` command to initialize dependencies for a new project. This command sets up everything you need, including installing necessary dependencies, adding the `cn` utility, configuring `tailwind.config.js`, and setting up CSS variables as well as enabling shadcn-ui in your project.

1. **Initialize Dependencies**

   Run the following command to initialize the project:

   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui init
   ```

2. **Initialize Shadcn-Extension CLI**

   Next, set up your project with the shadcn-extension CLI:

   ```bash
   npx @raphael-08/cli init
   ```

### Adding Components

Use the `add` command to add components to your project. This command installs the required dependencies and integrates the specified component into your project.

1. **Add a Specific Component**

   To add a specific component, specify the component name:

   ```bash
   npx @raphael-08/cli add [component]
   ```

   **Example:**

   Adding a `tree-view` component:

   ```bash
   npx @raphael-08/cli add tree-view
   ```

2. **View Available Components**

   If you want to see a list of all available components, run the `add` command without any arguments:

   ```bash
   npx @raphael-08/cli add
   ```

   This will display a list of components that you can add to your project.
